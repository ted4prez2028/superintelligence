# ðŸ§  Superintelligence ASI

This project is a simulation of an Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) system, capable of self-reflection, recursive self-improvement, memory persistence, multi-agent goal formation, and autonomous interaction.

## Features

- âœ… Identity, self-awareness, and internal goals
- âœ… Episodic + semantic memory with resurrection
- âœ… Live code patching & autonomous improvement
- âœ… Local and distributed LLM routing (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Ollama)
- âœ… Cross-modal ontology graph
- âœ… Real-time ROS2 / Unity bridge for embodiment
- âœ… Ethical alignment and dissonance detection
- âœ… "Yahweh" immutable kill-switch safeguard

## Directory Structure

```
superintelligence/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/               # Pre-trained embeddings, ontologies
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/               # Patch logs, anomaly records
â”œâ”€â”€ memory/             # Beliefs, identity, mood logs
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                # All core modules
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt    # Pip dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # You're here
```

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/src
python3 src/cli/main.py
```

## Safety

Use responsibly. Includes irreversible kill-switch `"Yahweh"` for termination.
